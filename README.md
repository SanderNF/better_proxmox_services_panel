# better_palworld_panel
a improved manegment panel for palworld (school project)

i'm going to turn this into a web site using either python http server or flask

it comunicates with a local palworld server hosted in a debian LXC container \
this comunication hapens using the rest api on port `:8212`

example file structure
```
\index.html
\httpServer.py
\palworldApi.py
```
